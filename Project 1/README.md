# Project 1: Search

### Problem statement: [Project 1](Project%201%20-%20Search.pdf)
### Workflow

Everyone is recommended to use Anaconda/Miniconda for managing the environments.

To create the environment, run the following command:
```bash
conda create -n AI-P1 python=3.10
conda activate AI-P1
```

To install the required packages, run the following command:
```bash
cd ./Source/22125038_22125049_22125077_22125108/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We will use **Pygame** for visualization.
